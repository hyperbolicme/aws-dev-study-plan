# edited src/config/database.js to include RDS configurations and apis. for initial testing database name needs to be commented out in .env and in database.js db configuration.

# create the database weatherapp and uncomment above. 

```bash
# First create the database
mysql -h database-how-is-your-day.czkuw6owug4e.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS weatherapp;"
```

## check for tables

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-13-101:~/how-is-your-day/backend$ mysql -h database-how-is-your-day.czkuw6owug4e.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p weatherapp -e "SHOW TABLES;"
Enter password:
ubuntu@ip-172-31-13-101:~/how-is-your-day/backend$
```

The MySQL connection worked and no tables were shown (empty result), which means the database exists but the tables haven't been created yet.

```bash
# Make sure the database config is correctly pointing to weatherapp
# Uncomment the database line if it's still commented
grep -n "database:" src/config/database.js

# Initialize the database schema
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs) && node -e "
const { initializeDatabase } = require('./src/config/database');
initializeDatabase().then(() => console.log('Tables created successfully')).catch(console.error);
"
